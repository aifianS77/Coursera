By University of California, Irvine

# Course Overview

**Week 1: Introduction to Arduino**
- Composed of three things: the Arduino board, the Arduino IDE, and the Arduino-compatible shields together with their libraries.

**Week 2: Understanding C Programming Basics**
- Covers the basics of the C programming language which will be used to write code for the Arduino
- Covers basic syntax, variables, and types. Most of the basic C operators are presented.

**Week 3: Interfacing with Sensors and Actuators**
- Describes the composition of an Arduino program, or sketch, and the process by which it is compiled and uploaded

**Week 4: Advanced Topics and Project Development**
- Introduction on debugging embedded software on an Arduino We 
- Discuss the basic debugging requirements: controllability and observability. 
- Debugging environment using the UART communication protocol to gain controllability and observability.
